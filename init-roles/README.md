# `init-roles`

Defines some IAM roles that are needed in every AWS account in the system. These roles are the minimum that allows the Landing AWS Account to setup what it needs.

* iam.tf - Role "landing-iam-role" (used by the "iam" CodePipeline to create roles that users can AssumeRole into)
* terraform-infrastructure-role - Role "terraform-infrastructure" that can be assumed by:
  * Landing AWS account user/roles (which also need permission via ../modules/assume),
    which is the way that developers will administer this AWS account
  * CodeBuild, which will ...(to be described)

## Why

When the [role module](../modules/role) is invoked it attempts to assume the role created by this module and create the
IAM resources it defines.

**Note**: This module must be invoked in all new and existing AWS accounts at least once before the main portion of this repository's
resources will work.

## Usage

**Note**: Requires an account with the necessary permissions to the target account

```bash
terraform init
```

```bash
terraform plan
```

```bash
terraform apply
```
